At my core I am a systems administrator and software engineer. Starting in
the year 2000, I grew up immersed in the Seattle tech and startup scene
around other professional systems administrators, software engineers, and
security researchers. I share the same undying passion for better software
and technology with many of my professional colleagues and friends. I have
sought to establish a strong, security-minded skill set throughout my career
as well as a vital appreciation for productive technology that must
interface with the non-technical world.
